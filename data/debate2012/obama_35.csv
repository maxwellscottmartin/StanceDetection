34,"Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it."
1,And private insurers have to make a profit.
0,Nothing wrong with that.
0,That's what they do.
20,"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that."
4,"And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere."
34,"And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies."
34,"And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck."
34,And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.
8,And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.
16,One last point I want to make.
34,"We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid|"
0,but but but overall.
0,And so|
0,Is that a is that a separate topic?
0,I'm sorry.
0,Absolutely.
0,I think this is a great example.
4,The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.
9,"Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street."
13,"You had loan officers were that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify."
13,You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.
25,You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone great investments when they weren't.
31,"But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable."
0,So what did we do?
2,We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the one thousand nine hundred thirtys.
25,"We said you've got banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements."
25,You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.
4,We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.
4,"In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest."
23,"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd Frank."
25,"And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation."
14,"But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back."
4,And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?
14,"Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate."
0,But that's not what I believe.
14,"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about."
1,And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.
4,"It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country."
1,"If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all."
1,"If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit."
1,"And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit."
2,"So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle class families are secure in this country."
1,And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.
1,"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover."
1,You keep your own insurance.
34,You keep your own doctor.
1,But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.
9,They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.
1,They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance your insurance plan until you're twenty six years old.
1,And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.
1,"Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market."
16,"Now, the last point I'd make before|"
14,"No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there."
2,It hasn't destroyed jobs.
1,"And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold."
14,Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.
16,This was a bipartisan idea.
9,"In fact, it was a Republican idea."
14,And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.
16,"And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan."
1,"It when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?"
1,Because there there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.
1,"One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line."
34,"Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?"
9,And there are ways of doing it.
1,"So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average."
9,And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.
1,"They they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with ten tests."
34,Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.
34,Let's let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've they've engaged in.
34,"Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do."
1,"And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down."
1,"And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up it's true but they've gone up slower than any time in the last fifty years."
9,So we're already beginning to see progress.
1,"In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate."
0,Let me make one last point.
14,"Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but but we can replace it with something."
9,"But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states."
1,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre existing condition be able to finally buy insurance."
1,"In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at fifty million people losing health insurance|"
30,at a time when it's vitally important.
8,Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.
9,That's explicitly prohibited in the law.
1,"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions."
14,"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does."
1,"What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've if it's been under ninety days."
1,But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.
14,There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.
1,It wasn't a government takeover of health care.
1,It was the largest expansion of private insurance.
1,"But what it does say is that insurers, you've got to take everybody."
18,"Now, that also means that you've got more customers."
1,"But when when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem."
4,"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan."
4,"That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details."
23,"He says that he's going to replace Dodd Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones."
30,He won't tell us.
1,He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.
14,"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?"
20,Is it is it because that somehow middle class families are going to benefit too much from them?
0,No.
2,"The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices."
20,And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle class families all across the country.
0,"Well, I definitely think there are differences."
31,The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.
0,That's its most basic function.
9,"And as commander in chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office."
2,"But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed."
25,"Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions."
32,"But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together."
13,"So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off."
9,That doesn't restrict people's freedom.
0,That enhances it.
9,And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.
13,And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.
9,We use something called Race to the Top.
14,"Wasn't a top down approach, Governor."
4,"What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate refor Miss And as a consequence, you had forty six states around the country who have made a real difference."
2,But what I've also said is let's hire another one hundred thousand math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.
30,And hard pressed states right now can't all do that.
13,"In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers."
34,"I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help."
0,"It can't do it all, but it can make a difference."
2,And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.
8,"Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play."
16,"Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now."
4,"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices."
14,"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference."
4,"You know, his his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about."
4,And it wasn't very detailed.
0,This seems to be a trend.
4,"But but what it did do is to if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to twenty percent."
13,"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now."
13,And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training progra Miss |
0,Let me just finish the point.
13,The where they're partnering so that they're designing training progra Miss And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.
9,"That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support."
16,Let me just say one final example.
13,"When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two year or four year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending dollar sixty billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed."
4,"So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system."
4,"And we said, Why not cut out the middleman?"
13,"And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans."
5,And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.
13,"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, you should borrow money from your parents to go to college, you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option."
13,"And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids."
2,It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.
18,You've done a great job.
14,"Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them."
20,"But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class."
25,That's how we cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses.
4,That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.
2,That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.
9,That's how we repealed don't ask/don't tell.
8,"That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan."
29,That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.
16,So we've we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.
14,"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, I'll sit down, but you have to have a plan."
30,"Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to to to folks both in your own party and in the other party."
4,"And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?"
18,"Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had."
1,"When when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have."
9,"And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things."
14,"And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party."
14,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it."
26,And I want to thank the University of Denver.
29,"You know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis."
14,And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.
20,"And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at fifty five to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession."
11,"The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they're helping to build America."
8,And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths.
2,"And everything that I've tried to do, and everything that I'm now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we're closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future."
9,"All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is is channeled and and they have an opportunity to succeed."
26,And everybody's getting a fair shot.
20,"And everybody's getting a fair share everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules."
9,"You know, four years ago, I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president."
14,And that's probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I've kept.
20,"But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class."
30,"I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term."
18,"Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright."
13,And the fact that you're making an investment in higher education is critical.
28,"Not just to you, but to the entire nation."
2,"Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country."
2,"But not just jobs, good paying jobs."
20,Ones that can support a family.
2,"And what I want to do, is build on the five million jobs that we've created over the last thirty months in the private sector alone."
13,And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.
2,"Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again."
14,Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.
2,I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.
2,"I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here."
25,It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.
13,"Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world."
13,"And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future."
12,"Number three, we've got to control our own energy."
12,"Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, twenty years from now."
12,"That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars."
4,"We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way."
13,Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.
4,"And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools."
9,"We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well."
14,"Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true."
25,He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.
2,And we would have lost a million jobs.
14,"And that don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney."
2,But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.
14,And Governor Romney's says he's got a five point plan?
14,Governor Romney doesn't have a five point plan.
0,He has a one point plan.
9,And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.
14,"That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate."
20,You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.
2,You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.
25,"You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money."
9,That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.
20,That's what's been squeezing middle class families.
9,And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.
9,The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.
12,The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.
9,So here's what I've done since I've been president.
12,We have increased oil production to the highest levels in sixteen years.
12,Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.
2,We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.
12,But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.
8,We've also got to look to the future.
12,That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.
12,"That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas."
12,That's why we doubled clean clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.
12,And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in sixteen years.
16,"Now, I want to build on that."
12,"And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling."
12,We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.
12,We've got potentially six hundred thousand jobs and one hundred years worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.
12,And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.
12,"But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower."
12,"Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all of the above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies."
12,"So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part."
4,"And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about ten years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future."
2,"Because China, Germany, they're making these investments."
2,And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.
12,I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.
2,That's going to help Jeremy get a job.
12,It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.
12,"Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently."
14,And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.
3,We've opened up public lands.
12,We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my the previous president was an oil man.
12,And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.
2,We're encouraging it and working with the industry.
14,"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, This plant kills, and took great pride in shutting it down."
12,And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.
9,So what I've tried to do is be consistent.
12,"With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter."
12,"Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas."
12,And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in twenty years.
12,"Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient."
2,And that's creating jobs.
12,"That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook."
8,"That's the strategy you need, an all of the above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years."
14,"Not true, Governor Romney."
0,Not true.
12,"Governor, we have actually produced more oil."
14,"Governor Romney, here's what we did."
12,There were a whole bunch of oil companies.
0,You want me to answer a question?
18,I'm happy to answer the question.
0,Here's what happened.
12,You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.
12,"So what we said was you can't just sit on this for ten, twenty, thirty years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you."
0,These are public lands.
12,"So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it."
9,And so what we did was take away those leases.
20,And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.
0,Production is up.
0,"No, it isn't."
0,Governor.
0,It's just not true.
0,Well|
0,.
0,OK.
14,"Well, think about what the governor think about what the governor just said."
14,"He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was dollar one."
0,"eighty, dollar one."
0,eighty six.
0,Why is that?
2,"Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting."
14,"So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess."
12,"What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy."
12,"And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once."
12,"So, I'm all for pipelines."
12,I'm all for oil production.
4,What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.
2,"So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs."
12,"When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed."
0,I'd get rid of it.
12,That's not an energy strategy for the future.
26,And we need to win that future.
9,And I intend to win it as President of the United States.
0,"Candy, it's not going to|"
0,Used to being interrupted.
0,You're doing great.
33,My philosophy on taxes has been simple.
20,"And that is, I want to give middle class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle class some relief."
26,Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.
28,"Over the last fifteen, over the last twenty years."
29,So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.
4,"Actually it was a town hall, and I said I would cut taxes for middle class families, and that's what I've done, by dollar three thousand six hundred|"
25,"I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth."
4,And we've cut them eighteen times.
25,"And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle class families, and for small business."
4,"But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more."
14,"So what I've said is, your first dollar two hundred fifty thousand."
20,"worth of income, no change."
25,"And that means ninety eight percent of American families, ninety seven percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase."
16,I'm ready to sign that bill right now.
4,The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the ninety eight percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top two percent.
4,"But what I've also says is for above dollar two hundred fifty thousand, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president."
2,We created twenty three million new jobs.
4,That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.
2,It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.
14,"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy."
20,"He was on sixty Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making dollar twenty million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making dollar fifty thousand year?"
14,"And he said, Yes, I think that's fair."
2,"Not only that, he said, I think that's what grows the economy."
0,"Well, I fundamentally disagree with that."
2,I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.
2,I think that grows the economy.
25,I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.
2,That grows our economy.
0,So we just have a different theory.
14,"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said I'm going to give tax cuts he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said tax cuts to everybody, including the top one percent, you should believe him because that's been his history."
20,And that's exactly the kind of top down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.
0,"No, it's not settled."
1,"Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, twenty percent."
4,"Along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along what he wants to do in terms of corporates, changes in the tax code, it costs about dollar five trillion."
4,Governor Romney then also wants to spend dollar two trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.
4,That's dollar seven trillion.
4,He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
4,That's another trillion dollars that's dollar eight trillion.
4,"Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes."
33,"But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?"
0,He can't tell you.
4,The the fact that he only has to pay fourteen percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.
4,"He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we we're not going to get money that way."
14,We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.
14,"Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor."
4,"If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend dollar seven or dollar eight trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up."
4,"And and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, dollar seven trillion dollar eight trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have."
4,"Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that that will pay for about four percent reduction in tax rates."
0,You're going to be paying for it.
33,"You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch."
4,"Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up."
0,Great.
0,Looking forward to it.
26,"And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you."
0,"Well, Katherine, that's a great question."
13,"And, you know, I was raised by a single mom who had to put herself through school while looking after two kids."
20,And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.
25,"My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank."
13,"She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip."
20,"And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling."
20,She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.
0,She didn't complain.
9,That's not what you did in that generation.
10,And this is one of the reasons why one of the first the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.
20,"And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it."
0,So we fixed that.
20,"And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family."
20,"This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it."
13,It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.
13,"Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people."
29,"Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done."
13,"We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country."
13,"We did it by taking dollar sixty billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman."
13,Let's give the money directly to students.
13,"And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace."
9,"But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination."
9,That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.
9,I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.
14,"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?"
14,"He said, I'll get back to you."
20,And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.
20,"Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace."
1,"For example, their healthcare."
14,You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.
0,I think that's a mistake.
1,"In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured."
20,"Because this is not just a a health issue, it's an economic issue for women."
0,It makes a difference.
34,This is money out of that family's pocket.
1,"Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."
20,That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.
14,"When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings."
20,That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.
20,And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.
4,"When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing."
20,That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and and earn a living for their family.
20,These are not just women's issues.
0,These are family issues.
2,These are economic issues.
20,And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.
13,And I've got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybody's sons have.
9,That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.
0,"I don't think so, Candy."
27,I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.
0,Governor|
8,"Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times."
2,We were losing eight hundred thousand jobs a month when I started.
4,But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.
2,"Now, we've seen thirty consecutive thirty one consecutive months of job growth; five."
2,two million new jobs created.
4,And the plans that I talked about will create even more.
4,"But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts."
4,That's what took us from surplus to deficit.
14,"When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks."
14,"That's Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China."
2,"And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field."
9,We've brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and we've won every single one that's been decided.
2,"When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers."
2,"Well, in fact we saved one thousand jobs."
25,And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.
16,But the last point I want to make is this.
14,"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush."
34,George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.
17,George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.
17,He didn't call for self deportation.
4,"George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy."
9,"In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy."
0,And I think that's a mistake.
2,That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.
9,"Well, we've gone through a tough four years."
0,There's no doubt about it.
4,"But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle class families."
0,And I did.
25,"I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have."
8,"I said that I'd end the war in Iraq, and I did."
29,"I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on nine/eleven, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead."
1,"I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have."
4,"I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the one thousand nine hundred thirtys."
2,"We've created five million jobs, and gone from eight hundred jobs a month being lost, and we are making progress."
2,We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse.
27,"Now, does that mean you're not struggling?"
0,Absolutely not.
0,A lot of us are.
4,"And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work."
12,"Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future."
16,"All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept."
9,"And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term."
14,"But, you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well."
9,And I suspect he'll keep those too.
4,"You know when members of the Republican Congress say, We're going to sign a no tax pledge, so that we don't ask a dime for millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education, and helping kids go to college."
0,"He said, Me too."
4,"When they said, We're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding."
0,"He said, Me too."
1,"When he said, We're going to repeal Obamacare."
1,"First thing I'm going to do, despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well."
0,"He said, Me too."
9,"That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep."
30,the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life?
13,Make sure your kids can go to college.
34,"Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security|"
0,will be there for you.
14,This is for Governor Romney?
18,"Good, I look forward to it."
17,Was Lorranna Lorraine we are a nation of immigrants.
17,I mean we're just a few miles away from Ellis Island.
2,We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.
0,People are willing to take risks.
13,People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have an even bigger dreams than they have.
9,But we're also a nation of laws.
17,So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.
17,"The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth."
25,They'll start new businesses.
2,They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.
17,"Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we put more border patrol on the any time in history and the flow of undocumented works across the border is actually lower than it's been in forty years."
17,"What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families."
5,And that's what we've done.
13,"And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents."
7,"Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag."
15,Think of this as their country.
17,Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.
17,And we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.
9,And that's what I've done administratively.
17,"Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to help those young people too, but during the Republican primary, he said, I will veto the DREAM Act, that would allow these young people to have access."
17,"His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, We're going to encourage self deportation."
2,Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.
17,He called the Arizona law a model for the nation.
17,Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.
0,You know what?
17,"If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want I don't want to empower somebody like that."
34,"So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way."
14,"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, Well Obama didn't try."
0,That's not true.
16,I have sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term.
9,"And I said, let's fix this system."
23,Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.
17,"But it's very hard for Republican's in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform, if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something I'm interested in supporting."
0,Candy?
0,Hold on a second.
0,The|
0,I've got to say|
34,"You know, I I don't look at my pension."
25,It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.
27,I don't check it that often.
17,I thought we were talking about immigration.
0,I do want to make sure that|
8,I do want to make sure that I do want to make sure that we just understand something.
14,Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.
17,"His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E Verify, the whole thing."
9,That's his policy.
9,And it's a bad policy.
2,And it won't help us grow.
17,"Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise."
12,And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.
13,And we want to encourage that.
9,"Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better."
17,"But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't|"
16,we can't we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.
16,And it's time for them to get serious on it.
16,This used to be a bipartisan issue.
0,OK.
0,"Hi, Kerry."
0,I'm sorry.
0,What's your name?
18,Great to see you.
0,Ah.
15,"Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation."
9,"And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives."
13,"I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way."
19,I know these folks and I know their families.
31,So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.
29,"So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions."
29,"Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region."
29,"Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again."
29,"And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them."
14,Now Governor Romney had a very different response.
29,"While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates."
9,You don't turn national security into a political issue.
9,Certainly not right when it's happening.
9,And people not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.
31,"But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say."
8,"I said I'd end the war in Libya in in Iraq, and I did."
8,"I said that we'd go after al Qaeda and bin Laden, we have."
8,"I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing."
29,"And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable."
5,"And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home."
0,You know that I mean what I say.
29,Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job.
0,But she works for me.
9,"I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do."
29,"The day after the attack, governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people in the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened."
29,That this was an act of terror and I also said that we're going to hunt down those who committed this crime.
5,"And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families."
14,"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U."
0,N.
14,"Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive."
0,That's not what we do.
9,"That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief."
0,That's what I said.
14,Please proceed governor.
0,Get the transcript.
18,"Can you say that a little louder, Candy?"
0,Candy?
0,"Candy, I'm|"
18,I'm happy to have a longer conversation|
8,about foreign policy.
0,OK.
18,"I'm happy to do that, too."
0,I just want to make sure that|
18,all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.
10,"We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment."
10,We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.
9,"But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody."
3,Most recently out in Aurora.
29,"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater."
29,And her son had been shot through the head.
7,"And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new."
20,But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.
10,"So my belief is that,, we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill."
31,"We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement."
8,But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.
8,And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.
10,Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.
29,But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.
10,"Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK forty sevens."
15,They're using cheap hand guns.
13,"And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control."
8,And so what I want is a is a comprehensive strategy.
10,Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.
8,But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.
13,"because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then they're less likely to engage in these kind of violent acts."
8,"We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed, and we've got to make sure they don't get weapons."
13,"But we can make a difference in terms ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed."
13,"And, Candy, we haven't had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms we've put in place, working with forty six governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed."
13,We're starting to see gains in math and science.
13,"When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school but now are getting another chance, training them for the jobs that exist right now."
2,"And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers."
15,And so we're matching them up.
13,Giving them access to higher education.
13,"As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before."
0,Now|
0,But but it'll it'll it'll be|
0,just one second.
30,Because because this is important.
30,This is part of the choice in this election.
2,"When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers, hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesn't grow our economy."
14,When when he was asked would class size|
0,I understand.
2,But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people|
15,and reduce our violence.
0,OK.
2,We need to create jobs here.
14,And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.
0,It's too high.
9,But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.
33,"I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore."
9,All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.
14,"Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks."
25,"One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U."
0,S.
0,taxes.
25,"But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom and pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about."
2,And it's estimated that that will create eight hundred thousand new jobs.
2,The problem is they'll be in china.
0,Or India.
0,Or Germany.
2,That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.
2,"The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports."
4,"And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was president."
2,That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.
2,"That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal."
14,"Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated."
2,"In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called pioneers of outsourcing."
0,That's not my phrase.
29,That's what reporters called it.
9,"And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up eleven percent since I've been president because we have pushed them hard."
15,And we've put unprecedented trade pressure on China.
9,That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.
2,That's going to help to create jobs here.
2,"Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back."
20,"Because they are low wage, low skill jobs."
20,"I want high wage, high skill jobs."
2,That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.
2,That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.
8,That's why we've got to make sure that we've got the best science and research in the world.
4,"And when we talk about deficits, if we're adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and we're cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race."
13,If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.
25,Then companies won't come here.
2,"Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but ten years from now, fifty years from now, one hundred years from now."
2,"Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer."
0,That's not what I believe.
25,I believe that the free enterprise system is the greatest engine of prosperity the world's ever known.
20,I believe in self reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.
20,"But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that's how our economy's grown."
20,That's how we built the world's greatest middle class.
30,And and that is part of what's at stake in this election.
9,There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.
14,I believe Governor Romney is a good man.
28,"Loves his family, cares about his faith."
14,"But I also believe that when he said behind closed doors that forty seven percent of the country considered themselves victims who refuse personal responsibility, think about who he was talking about."
34,Folks on Social Security who've worked all their lives.
5,Veterans who've sacrificed for this country.
13,"Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance their own dreams, but also this country's drea Miss Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now."
20,"People who are working hard every day, paying payroll tax, gas taxes, but don't make enough income."
8,And I want to fight for them.
9,That's what I've been doing for the last four years.
9,"Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds."
5,When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came back and he got a G.
0,I.
13,"Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that wasn't a handout."
9,That was something that advanced the entire country.
13,And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.
30,That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.
9,"Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe."
9,And that's what we've done over the last four years.
5,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on nine/eleven."
29,"And as a consequence, Al Qaeda's core leadership has been decimated."
8,"In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security."
15,And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.
29,"Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice."
9,And that's exactly what we're going to do.
29,But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.
8,"Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for forty years."
29,"Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend."
0,We stand with them.
30,Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.
8,"And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East."
14,"Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that Al Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you said Russia, in the one thousand nine hundred eightys, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for twenty years."
14,"But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the one thousand nine hundred eightys, just like the social policies of the one thousand nine hundred fiftys and the economic policies of the one thousand nine hundred twentys."
8,You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq.
8,"But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now."
8,"And the the challenge we have I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong."
8,"You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction."
8,You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.
15,"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that seventy one senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it."
8,"You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan."
9,Then you said we should.
8,"Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies."
8,"So, what what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map."
14,"And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul."
8,What I would not have had done was left ten thousand troops in Iraq that would tie us down.
8,And that certainly would not help us in the Middle East.
0,Governor|
0,Governor?
8,This was just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.
0,You you|
0,major speech.
0,Governor?
14,Governor here here's here's one thing|
9,here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.
8,"You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean."
8,You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.
8,That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.
8,"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just meet these challenges militarily."
9,"And so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts."
15,"Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region."
15,"Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population, not just half of it, is developing."
2,"Number four, we do have to develop their economic their economic capabilities."
8,"But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions."
9,Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.
9,That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.
8,"What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go."
15,We've mobilized sanctions against that government.
8,We have made sure that they are isolated.
8,"We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria."
8,"But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future."
8,"And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this."
8,"This what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition."
8,"But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping; that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or allies in the region."
8,And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.
8,"But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term."
30,We are playing the leadership role.
8,We organized the Friends of Syria.
8,"We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support for the opposition."
15,And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.
29,But going back to Libya because this is an example of how we make choices.
29,"When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize."
8,We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.
29,"And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized."
29,"But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle."
8,Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.
29,"You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden."
2,And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.
29,That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.
8,"But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with, and we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria."
9,That's exactly what we're doing.
0,"Well, I'll I'll be very quick."
14,What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesn't have different ideas.
8,And that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and a an effective transition so that we get Assad out.
8,That's the kind of leadership we've shown.
8,That's the kind of leadership we'll continue to show.
0,Right.
30,"No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy."
8,"The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F."
14,Kennedy talked about fifty years ago.
30,"But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities."
15,"And we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region."
13,These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.
15,They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.
15,"That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels."
8,They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.
13,"And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities."
13,Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.
13,"They want jobs, they want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school."
13,They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.
8,"And so one of the things that we've been doing is, is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent."
8,"But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region there's some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well."
12,"You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system."
8,And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do|
30,America remains the one indispensable nation.
9,"And the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office."
8,"Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan."
15,It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.
15,"And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat."
8,"But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does."
2,"Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas."
13,"Making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow."
12,Doing everything we can to control our own energy.
12,We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.
12,But we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by two thousand twenty.
8,That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.
4,And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.
14,"Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it."
4,"We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more."
4,That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.
14,"Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign."
9,"Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies."
14,He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's who shows great wisdom and judgment.
8,And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the twenty onest century.
26,"Well, let's talk about what we need to compete."
25,"First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses."
25,"But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about forty eightth, I think out of fifty states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses."
25,And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top.
28,And they include you and me.
25,That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.
13,But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the twenty onest century and that's our education policy.
8,We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.
7,"You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, forty six states."
13,We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.
16,And they're starting to finally make progress.
13,"And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science."
13,And those teachers can make a difference.
14,"Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow."
13,"When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference."
13,"But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference."
13,"And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here."
2,Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.
4,"And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward, when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long term competitiveness."
9,"That is not good for America's position in the world, and the world notices."
0,Ten years earlier|
9,But that was ten years before you took office.
9,That happened before you came into office.
14,He should have answered the first question.
4,"Look, Governor Romney's called for dollar five trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions."
9,"Now, the math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's going to do it."
4,He then wants to spend another dollar two trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.
4,"Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office."
4,"We spend more on our military than the next ten countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it."
0,The next ten.
8,"And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?"
4,And that's the budget that we've put forward.
4,"But, what you can't do is spend dollar two trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, dollar five trillion on tax cuts."
33,"You say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are."
4,And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.
9,The math simply doesn't work.
4,"But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities."
31,We need to be thinking about cyber security.
8,We need to be talking about space.
4,"That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy."
9,It's not driven by politics.
9,"It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see."
9,"It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?"
4,"That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern."
8,Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.
18,"Bob, I just need to comment on this."
4,"First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed."
16,It is something that Congress has proposed.
0,It will not happen.
4,The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.
0,It is maintaining it.
14,But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.
8,"You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in one thousand nine hundred sixteen."
4,"Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed."
8,"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them."
15,"We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."
26,"And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips."
8,It's what are our capabilities.
24,"And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home."
4,And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.
27,"And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work."
15,"First of all, Israel is a true friend."
15,It is our greatest ally in the region.
15,"And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel."
9,I've made that clear throughout my presidency.
0,And|
15,I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.
15,"And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history."
15,"In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week."
15,"But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon."
9,I made that clear when I came into office.
15,"We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy."
2,Their currency has dropped eighty percent.
12,Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq twenty years ago.
2,So their economy is in a shambles.
15,"And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security."
15,We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.
15,Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.
15,"And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non state actors, that's unacceptable."
15,And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.
15,So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.
15,"They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table."
14,"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action."
8,"I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."
27,"Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper."
0,They are not true.
15,But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.
0,N.
9,resolutions that have been in place.
17,"Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that."
15,There there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.
15,"And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program."
0,It's very straightforward.
14,And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.
14,"You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference."
2,And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.
0,It's meticulous.
9,We started from the day we got into office.
15,"And the reason is was so important and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China."
15,Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions we've had sanctions in place a long time.
15,It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.
16,And we've got to maintain that pressure.
9,"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established."
15,They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.
33,There are inspections that are very intrusive.
31,"But over time, what they can do is regain credibility."
8,"In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place."
16,And one last thing just just to make this point.
0,The clock is ticking.
15,We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.
7,And I've been very clear to them.
15,"You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program."
15,And that clock is ticking.
15,"And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon."
0,"Bob, let me just respond."
14,"Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing."
29,This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.
14,"And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true."
15,"And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever."
15,"And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector."
15,"So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions."
15,"And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for."
15,And and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.
9,"When I came into office, the world was divided."
15,Iran was resurgent.
15,"Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since then in many years."
15,And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.
9,That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.
14,"Bob, let me let me respond."
5,"If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops."
15,"And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors."
7,I didn't attend fundraisers.
15,"I went to Yad Beshef, the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable."
15,"And then I went down to the border towns of Storok, which had experienced missiles raining dowm from Hamas."
15,And I saw families there who showed me there where missiles had come down near their children's bedroo Miss And I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids.
15,"Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles."
15,"So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region."
16,And the the central question at this point is going to be: Who is going to be credible to all parties involved?
15,"And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities."
9,And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.
8,And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.
8,"Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map."
15,"I mean, I'm I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program."
9,But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do.
8,"In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends."
8,"In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have twenty thousand more folks in there."
29,The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.
9,"When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call."
29,"But when you were a candidate in two thousand eight, as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man."
15,And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.
15,"And if we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him."
18,And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.
29,"You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who was four years old when nine/eleven happened."
15,"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying Peyton, I love you and I will always watch over you."
6,"And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation."
29,"And she said to me, You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me."
5,"And when we do things like that when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world and it tells Peyton that we did not forget her father."
9,"And I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not always popular."
30,Those decisions generally generally are not poll tested.
14,"And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did."
9,"But what the American people understand is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions."
8,"When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade."
8,"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops."
8,That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.
8,And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.
29,Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.
29,We went because there were people who were responsible for three thousand American deaths.
8,And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
8,We then started to build up Afghan forces.
8,"And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country."
9,"Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion."
8,"We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need."
8,But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.
24,"And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place."
24,"You know, I was having lunch with some a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances."
13,"When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch."
13,And what we've said is let's change those certifications.
24,The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.
24,"And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population."
9,It was higher when I came into office.
8,So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.
8,"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden."
15,"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan."
9,"And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works."
15,"So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries."
30,And we have stood on the side of democracy.
8,"One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation me, my administration stood with them earlier than just about any country."
30,In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.
29,In Libya we stood on the side of the people.
15,"And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed."
15,But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.
8,And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.
8,But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.
29,"The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office."
15,And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.
0,S.
15,homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.
31,"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks."
8,"We have to remain vigilant, as I just said."
15,"But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules."
9,So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.
2,I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.
25,And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.
9,"That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other the previous administration had done in two ter Miss And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided."
11,"In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest Pennsylvania are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case."
19,We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires or or cheap Chinese tires.
2,And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.
14,I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.
20,"But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way."
16,They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.
8,"Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking taking care of business here at home."
13,"If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition."
4,"And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments."
2,"Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas."
0,"And, you know, that's you're right."
9,I mean that's how our free market works.
20,But I've made a different bet on American workers.
14,"If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China."
25,If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.
0,S.
33,taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.
2,"Now that's estimated to create eight hundred thousand jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China."
12,"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the in things like clean energy technology."
15,"Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U."
0,S.
2,"exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U."
0,S.
25,exporters since one thousand nine hundred ninety three.
8,We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.
8,"And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future."
15,"And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there."
8,"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues."
15,And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.
8,That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.
8,That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.
14,"Governor Romney, that's not what you said|"
14,"Governor Romney, you did not|"
34,You did not say that you would provide government help.
0,Let's check the record.
0,Let let let's|
0,at the record.
14,"Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget."
0,Governor?
0,The fact of the matter is|
0,Yeah.
0,Governor?
0,I'm I'm I'm happy.
0,to respond to you|
18,you've had the floor for a while.
27,"The look, I think anybody out there can check the record."
14,"Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here."
4,"You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U."
0,S.
25,"auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy."
9,You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.

0,"No, I am not wrong."
0,I am not wrong.
0,People will look it up.
30,"But more importantly it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now."
13,"Cutting our education budget, that's not a smart choice."
2,That will not help us compete with China.
4,"Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice."
2,That will not help us compete with China.
4,"Bringing down our deficit by adding dollar seven trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military is not asking for, before we even get to the debt that we currently have, that is not going to make us more competitive."
30,Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.
2,"Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States, that will not make us more competitive."
2,"And the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress."
9,What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.
9,That's why we have to move forward and not go back.
14,"Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University."
30,"You've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials."
30,And now you've got a choice.
4,"Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression."
14,"And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies, a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless, economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do."
9,And I've got a different vision for America.
8,I want to build on our strengths.
25,"And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas."
13,I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world.
2,And we're retaining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.
12,I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.
4,"Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a twenty onest century economy."
8,"As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm."
5,"but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we've got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our freedom."
30,"And we've been through tough times but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together and if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices."
5,I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.
0,Thank you.
