34,What I support is no change for current retirees and near retirees to Medicare.
4,And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred sixteen billion out of that program.
0,So that's that's number one.
34,"Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan."
0,Their choice.
1,They get to choose and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.
20,"So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional dollar six thousand."
0,That's not going to happen.
4,They'll have at least two plans.
34,"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan."
27,I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.
1,I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.
1,I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.
1,"If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company."
30,But people make their own choice.
34,The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?
20,"We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits."
34,We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.
9,That's the plan that I've put forward.
23,"And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or or Senator Wyden, who's the co author of the bill with with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill Bill Clinton's chief of staff."
34,"This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality."
22,I believe in competition.
0,That's that's a big topic.
34,Can we can we stay on Medicare?
34,Let's get back to Medicare.
34,Let's get back to Medicare.
14,The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.
9,"If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase."
25,But my experience my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.
0,Absolutely.
0,Absolutely.
0,Regulation is essential.
2,You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.
25,"As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the regulations."
0,I needed them there.
25,You couldn't have people opening up banks in their in their garage and making loans.
2,"I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work."
9,Every free economy has good regulation.
9,"At the same time, regulation can become excessive."
0,"In some places, yes."
0,"Other places, no."
0,"No, it can become out of date."
9,"And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt it's hurt the economy."
0,Let me give you an example.
23,Dodd Frank was passed.
2,And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.
33,"One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government."
25,This is the biggest kiss that's been given to to New York banks I've ever seen.
18,This is an enormous boon for them.
25,There've been one hundred twenty two community and small banks have closed since Dodd Frank.
0,So there's one example.
0,Here's another.
23,In Dodd Frank|
1,"Well, I would repeal and replace it."
9,We're not going to get rid of all regulation.
9,You have to have regulation.
23,And there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all the sense in the world.
31,"You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for|"
6,But let's let's mention let me mention the other one.
0,Let's talk|
9,"Sorry, but that's just not that's just not the facts."
9,"Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street."
9,That's why I'd have regulation.
25,But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.
23,That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank.
0,It wasn't thought through properly.
25,We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.
0,They're getting hurt.
9,Let me mention another regulation in Dodd Frank.
13,You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.
0,That's exactly right.
2,It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.
16,"And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was."
0,It's been two years.
2,We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.
13,"So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages."
13,Try and get a mortgage these days.
9,It's hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.
9,It's not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.
9,Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.
2,"I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs."
0,I sure do.
27,"Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience."
11,"You know, I was in New Hampshire."
1,"A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son."
1,"I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it."
1,"And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive."
20,And and we've got to deal with cost.
1,"And, unfortunately, when when when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more than traditional insurance."
0,So it's adding to cost.
1,"And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by dollar two thousand five hundred a family."
20,"Instead, it's gone up by that amount."
0,So it's expensive.
20,Expensive things hurt families.
9,So that's one reason I don't want it.
34,"Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen billion from Medicare to pay for it."
34,I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.
1,"Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have."
0,I don't like that idea.
1,"Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?"
2,And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.
1,"I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing twenty three million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people."
2,It has killed jobs.
11,And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.
1,"And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the dollar two thousand five hundred additional premium."
14,"Well, I did with my first statement."
9,"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts."
30,"I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together."
1,What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.
1,"As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway."
16,"So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through."
16,"What we did in a legislature eighty seven percent Democrat, we worked together; two hundred legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished."
0,What were some differences?
4,We didn't raise taxes.
1,You've raised them by dollar one trillion under Obamacare.
34,We didn't cut Medicare.
34,"Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by dollar seven hundred sixteen billion."
34,We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.
1,"We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted."
1,"Right now, the CBO says up to twenty million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year."
1,"And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said thirty percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage."
1,"So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare don't want Obamacare."
9,"It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had had the plan."
0,They put a plan out.
16,"They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan."
0,It was swept aside.
16,"I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis."
9,And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.
0,Well|
27,"Well, actually it's it's it's a lengthy description."
1,"But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan."
13,"Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan."
9,That's already offered in the private marketplace.
9,You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.
1,"But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families."
9,"And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have."
4,"In my opinion, the government is not effective in in bringing down the cost of almost anything."
1,"As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be."
1,"Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe."
0,This is the private market.
25,"These are small these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs."
25,"I used to consult to businesses excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers."
14,I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.
1,"In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of fifteen people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have."
1,"We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening."
1,"Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others."
1,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have."
0,That's the wrong way to go.
9,The private market and individual responsibility always work best.
0,No.
0,I I have to respond to that.
14,"Which is which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and and lay down a piece of legislation and say, It's my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done."
9,What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.
9,"When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster."
4,He said he was going to lower tax rates.
14,He said he was going to broaden the base.
4,"You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base."
0,Those are my principles.
20,I want to bring down the tax burden on middle income families.
16,"And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?"
9,"One way, for instance, would be to have a single number."
20,"Make up a number, dollar twenty five thousand, dollar fifty thousand."
33,Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.
20,And then that number disappears for high income people.
0,That's one way one could do it.
33,One could follow Bowles Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.
4,"There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth."
1,"And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre existing condition plan."
27,You obviously studied up on on my plan.
1,"In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre existing conditions."
1,That's part of my health care plan.
9,And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.
0,And I said that at that time.
1,"The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the tenth Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy."
13,"Well, first, I love great schools."
13,"Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all fifty states."
13,"And the key to great schools, great teachers."
13,So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.
13,"Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own."
30,The role of government: Look behind us.
32,The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
30,The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.
28,"First, life and liberty."
5,"We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none."
4,I do not believe in cutting our military.
5,I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.
30,"Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country."
9,That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.
34,"I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by by one another."
34,"We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled."
0,We care for them.
12,"And we we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens."
30,But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.
2,"And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a a trickle down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their drea Miss And it's not working."
2,And the proof of that is twenty three million people out of work.
20,The proof of that is one out of six people in poverty.
2,The proof of that is we've gone from thirty two million on food stamps to forty seven million on food stamps.
2,The proof of that is that fifty percent of college graduates this year can't find work.
9,We know that the path we're taking is not working.
0,It's time for a new path.
13,"Well, the primary responsibility for education is is, of course, at the state and local level."
30,But the federal government also can play a very important role.
14,"And I and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and and congratulate him for pursuing that."
13,The federal government can get local and and state schools to do a better job.
27,"My own view, by the way, is I've added to that."
13,"I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I these are disabled kids or or or poor kids or or lower income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice."
13,"So all federal funds, instead of going to the to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their their their student."
9,"Mister President, Mister President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts."
13,"All right, I'm not going to cut education funding."
13,I don't have any plan to cut education funding and and grants that go to people going to college.
0,I'm planning on to grow.
9,So I'm not planning on making changes there.
4,"But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is."
2,You put dollar ninety billion into into green jobs.
12,"And I look, I'm all in favor of green energy."
13,"dollar ninety billion, that would have that would have hired two million teachers."
0,dollar ninety billion.
25,"And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business."
30,A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.
1,"Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world."
4,"The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?"
13,How do we get schools to be more competitive?
0,Let's grade them.
13,"I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a to a school that he's being more successful."
13,I don't want to cut our commitment to education.
25,I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.
7,"And by the way, I've had that experience."
0,I don't just talk about it.
0,I've been there.
13,Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.
13,This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.
13,It's because I care about education for all of our kids.
7,"Jim, I had the great experience it didn't seem like it at the time of being elected in a state where my legislature was eighty seven percent Democrat."
16,And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.
13,We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.
4,We cut taxes nineteen times.
14,"We as president, I will sit on day one actually, the day after I get elected I'll sit down with leaders the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue as we did in my state we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the in the in our state in that case."
8,"We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground."
2,"And the challenges America faces right now look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country."
4,And we face this deficit could crush the future generations.
15,"What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern."
30,And Republicans and Democrats both love America.
16,But we need to have leadership leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
0,I've done it before.
0,I'll do it again.
28,"Thank you, Jim, and Mister President."
18,And thank you for tuning in this evening.
30,This is a this is an important election and I'm concerned about America.
9,I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.
30,I I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals.
30,It's bigger than our respective parties.
30,It's an election about the course of America.
13,What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.
14,"And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate."
8,We're talk about those two paths.
9,But they lead in very different directions.
9,And it's not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go.
0,You can look at the record.
4,There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.
20,I'll get incomes up again.
2,You'll see chronic unemployment.
2,We've had forty three straight months with unemployment above eight percent.
2,If I'm president I will create help create twelve million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.
1,"If the president's reelected, Obamacare will be fully installed."
1,In my view that's going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past.
0,Many will lose it.
1,You're going to see health premiums go up by some dollar two thousand five hundred per family.
30,If I'm elected we won't have Obama.
34,We'll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we'll focus on getting the cost of health care down.
34,If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a dollar seven hundred sixteen billion cut to Medicare.
34,You'll have four million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.
34,You'll have hospital and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare patients.
34,I'll restore that dollar seven hundred sixteen billion to Medicare.
5,"And finally, military."
4,The president's reelected you'll see dramatic cuts to our military.
14,The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.
8,I will not cut our commitment to our military.
2,I will keep America strong and get America's middle class working again.
18,"Thank you, Jim."
18,"Thank you, Jeremy."
3,"I appreciate your your question, and thank you for being here this evening and to all of those from Nassau County that have come, thank you for your time."
7,Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this this event.
14,"Thank you, Mister President, also for being part of this this debate."
13,Your question your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.
7,"I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated this was in Philadelphia and she said, I've got my degree."
2,I can't find a job.
2,I've got three part time jobs.
20,They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.
13,I can't begin to pay back my student loans.
9,So what we have to do is two things.
13,We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college.
13,"And also make sure that when they get out of college, there's a job."
13,"When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree, you had to pass an exam."
13,"If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution."
13,I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing.
13,"We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school."
13,But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.
9,"And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people."
2,I want you to be able to get a job.
2,I know what it takes to get this economy going.
2,"With half of college kids graduating this year without a college excuse me, without a job."
2,"And without a college level job, that's just unacceptable."
4,And likewise you've got more and more debt on your back.
2,So more debt and less jobs.
0,I'm going to change that.
2,I know what it takes to create good jobs again.
22,I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.
2,"And kids across this country are going to recognize, we're bringing back an economy."
9,It's not going to be like the last four years.
2,"The middle class has been crushed over the last four years, and jobs have been too scarce."
13,"I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate when do you graduate?"
0,two thousand fourteen.
30,"When you come out in two thousand fourteen, I presume I'm going to be president."
2,I'm going to make sure you get a job.
0,Thanks Jeremy.
0,"Yeah, you bet."
2,Well what you're seeing in this country is twenty three million people struggling to find a job.
2,"And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time."
2,The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.
2,We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.
2,If the the unemployment rate was seven.
9,"eight percent when he took office, it's seven."
0,eight percent now.
2,"But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be ten."
0,seven percent.
2,We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.
2,That's why I put out a five point plan that gets America twelve million new jobs in four years and rising take home pay.
2,It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.
2,It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.
14,"And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt."
0,And that's right.
25,My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like seven Eleven did and Macy's and Condell Airlines and come out stronger.
14,"And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt."
9,"Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt."
25,You took General Motors bankrupt.
25,You took Chrysler bankrupt.
25,"So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did."
2,"And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people."
9,That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.
14,That that Detroit that Detroit answer|
0,that Detroit answer|
14,"and the rest of the answer, way off the mark."
9,"Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out."
12,"And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land."
12,"As a matter of fact, oil production is down fourteen percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down nine percent."
0,Why?
12,"Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters."
20,So where'd the increase come from?
12,Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.
7,What was his participation there?
12,"The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have."

10,twenty or twenty five birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.
12,"Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables."
12,"I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix."
12,"But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas."
12,"This has not been Mister Oil, or Mister Gas, or Mister Coal."
25,Talk to the people that are working in those industries.
0,I was in coal country.
2,"People grabbed my arms and said, Please save my job."
12,"The head of the EPA said, You can't build a coal plant."
9,You'll virtually it's virtually impossible given our regulations.
12,"When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt."
9,That's not the right course for America.
12,"Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy ources for the future."
12,"And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back."
12,"Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy."
12,I'll get America and North America energy independent.
12,"I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses."
12,We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.
12,How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?
0,I will never know.
2,"This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do."
9,But that's not what you've done in the last four years.
0,That's the problem.
12,"In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half."
4,So how much did you cut?
4,"How much did you cut them by, then?"
0,"No, no."
12,How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?
4,"No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?"
4,How much did you cut them by?
0,All right.
0,And it is.
0,"OK,|"
12,And production on private on government land.
0,is down.
12,Production on government land of oil is down fourteen percent.
12,And production on gas.
0,It's absolutely true.
12,"Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more on federal lands and in federal waters."
2,"And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up."
2,"I was just at a coal facility, where some one thousand two hundred people lost their jobs."
9,The right course for America is to have a true all of the above policy.
12,I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.
6,You'll get your chance in a moment.
0,I'm still speaking.
29,And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case|
0,That wasn't the question.
0,That was a statement.
9,I don't think the American people believe that.
12,"I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas."
20,"And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump."
4,"If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working."
20,But you're paying more.
12,"When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about dollar one."
0,eighty six a gallon.
20,"Now, it's dollar four."
0,a gallon.
12,The price of electricity is up.
12,"If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down."
12,"I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure."
12,"And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it."
12,Those things will get us the energy we need.
0,He gets the first.
0,He actually got|
0,He actually got the first question.
27,So I get the last question last answer|
0,"Candy, Candy|"
2,"Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that they're not phantom jobs."
2,They're real jobs.
11,I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.
12,I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.
0,I'm going to make sure|
12,we're taking advantage of our energy resources.
2,We'll bring back manufacturing to America.
2,"We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, thirty one/two million more jobs in this country."
30,It's critical to our future.
0,"Hi, Mary."
18,Thank you very much.
4,"And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle income taxpayers to have lower taxes."
4,And the reason I want middle income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.
20,"You've seen, as middle income people in this country, incomes go down dollar four thousand three hundred a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up dollar two thousand."
1,"Health insurance premiums, up dollar two thousand five hundred."
20,Food prices up.
12,Utility prices up.
20,The middle income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.
20,So I want to get some relief to middle income families.
0,That's part that's part one.
33,"Now, how about deductions?"
20,"'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now."
34,The top five percent of taxpayers will continue to pay sixty percent of the income tax the nation collects.
0,So that'll stay the same.
20,Middle income people are going to get a tax break.
4,"And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets I'll pick a number dollar twenty five thousand of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use."
33,"Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions."
20,"But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains."
33,No tax on your savings.
0,That makes life a lot easier.
33,"If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making dollar two hundred thousand."
27,"per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains."
4,Why am I lowering taxes on the middle class?
29,"Because under the last four years, they've been buried."
20,And I want to help people in the middle class.
20,"And I will not I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers."
20,"And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle class."
4,"The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people."
26,Not just at the high end.
20,A recent study has shown the people in the middle class will see dollar four thousand.
4,per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.
0,I will not let that happen.
4,"I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families."
9,And what's that going to do?
2,"It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country."
0,You're absolutely right.
4,You heard what I said about my tax plan.
34,"The top five percent will continue to pay sixty percent, as they do today."
4,I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.
4,I am looking to cut taxes for middle income people.
20,"And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?"
25,"Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people."
2,"And for me, this is about jobs."
2,I want to get America's economy going again.
2,Fifty four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.
25,"So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people."
14,"For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment."
0,We can do better than this.
2,"We don't have to settle for, how many months, forty three months with unemployment above eight percent, twenty three million Americans struggling to find a good job right now."
0,There are three.
20,five million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.
0,We don't have to live like this.
2,We can get this economy going again.
27,My five point plan does it.
12,Energy independence for North America in five years.
25,"Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America."
33,Cracking down on China when they cheat.
4,Getting us to a balanced budget.
13,Fixing our training programs for our workers.
25,"And finally, championing small business."
25,I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.
0,I know how to make that happen.
7,I spent my life in the private sector.
2,I know why jobs come and why they go.
9,And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.
0,I I|
0,Well of course they add up.
4,"I I was I was someone who ran businesses for twenty five years, and balanced the budget."
4,I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.
4,"I ran the the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years."
4,"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about dollar four trillion of deficits over the last four years, dollar five trillion?"
4,That's math that doesn't add up.
9,We have we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.
4,"And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half."
0,Instead he's doubled it.
4,"We've gone from dollar ten trillion of national debt, to dollar sixteen trillion of national debt."
4,"If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost dollar twenty trillion of national debt."
26,This puts us on a road to Greece.
4,I know what it takes to balance budgets.
0,I've done it my entire life.
4,"So for instance when he says, Yours is a dollar five trillion cut."
0,"Well, no it's not."
4,Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.
0,And|
4,"And I just described I just described to you, Mister President I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put and they can put they're they're deductions and credits|"
0,Thank you.
11,"And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men."
20,"And I and I went to my staff, and I said, How come all the people for these jobs are are all men."
2,"They said, Well, these are the people that have the qualifications."
20,"And I said, Well, gosh, can't we can't we find some some women that are also qualified?"
20,And and so we we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.
7,"I went to a number of women's groups and said, Can you help us find folks, and they brought us whole binders full of women."
11,"I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all fifty states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America."
26,Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.
20,"But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible."
13,"My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school."
6,"She said, I can't be here until seven or eight o'clock at night."
13,I need to be able to get home at five o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.
0,So we said fine.
20,Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.
2,"We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women."
2,In the in the last women have lost five hundred eighty thousand jobs.
9,That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.
2,We're still down five hundred eighty thousand jobs.
20,"I mentioned thirty one/two million women, more now in poverty than four years ago."
20,"What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford."
0,This is what I have done.
2,"It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like."
2,And an economy with seven.
2,eight percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.
2,An economy that has twenty three million people looking for work is not a strong economy.
2,"An economy with fifty percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have."
20,I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.
0,Thank you.
28,And I appreciate that question.
18,"I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe|"
0,I don't believe|
0,The time the time|
10,I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.
20,And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.
10,Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.
9,And and the and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.
27,Let me come back and and answer your question.
9,President Bush and I are are different people and these are different times and that's why my five point plan is so different than what he would have done.
12,"I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else."
12,"That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America become energy secure."
2,"Number two, trade I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't."
25,I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.
27,It's been growing about twelve percent per year over a long period of time.
2,I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.
4,"Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget."
9,President Bush didn't.
4,"President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years."
4,"He was right, but then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years."
4,"And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large."
9,So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.
25,"And then let's take the last one, championing small business."
30,Our party has been focused too long.
25,I came through small business.
25,I understand how hard it is to start a small business.
25,That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.
25,I want to keep their taxes down on small business.
25,"I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it."
1,"And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people."
2,My priority is jobs.
0,I know how to make that happen.
9,And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.
25,My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.
0,I think you know better.
14,I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.
14,"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get."
9,You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.
4,We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.
2,He said that by now we'd have unemployment at five.
0,four percent.
27,The difference between where it is and five.
2,four percent is nine million Americans without work.
0,I wasn't the one that said five.
0,four percent.
9,This was the president's plan.
0,Didn't get there.
34,"He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy."
9,He would reform them.
0,He'd get that done.
9,He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.
17,He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges.
0,Didn't even file it.
9,This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.
4,He said that he'd cut in half the deficit.
9,He hasn't done that either.
0,"In fact, he doubled it."
1,He said that by now middle income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by dollar two thousand five hundred a year.
20,It's gone up by dollar two thousand five hundred a year.
1,"And if Obamacare is passed, or implemented it's already been passed if it's implemented fully, it'll be another dollar two thousand five hundred on top."
2,The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.
2,"He keeps saying, Look, I've created five million jobs."
2,That's after losing five million jobs.
2,The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.
2,"The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still twenty three million Americans."
20,"There are more people in poverty, one out of six people in poverty."
20,How about food stamps?
2,"When he took office, thirty two million people were on food stamps."
2,"Today, forty seven million people are on food stamps."
2,How about the growth of the economy?
27,"It's growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before."
9,The president wants to do well.
0,I understand.
9,"But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have."
18,"You might say, Well, you got an example of one that worked better?"
2,"Yeah, in the Reagan recession where unemployment hit ten."
2,"eight percent, between that period the end of that recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald Reagan's recovery created twice as many jobs as this president's recovery."
2,Five million jobs doesn't even keep up with our population growth.
2,And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.
9,"The president has tried, but his policies haven't worked."
14,He's great as a as a as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.
18,"That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at."
4,"And that record shows he just hasn't been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need."
20,Median income is down dollar four thousand three hundred a family and twenty three million Americans out of work.
30,That's what this election is about.
13,It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.
0,Is it Loraina?
0,Lorraine?
0,Lorraine.
0,"Good, thanks."
0,Thank you.
0,Lorraine?
0,Did I get that right?
0,Good.
18,Thank you for your question.
17,And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.
17,"But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants."
17,We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.
17,My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first generation American.
17,We welcome legal immigrants into this country.
9,I want our legal system to work better.
0,I want it to be streamlined.
0,I want it to be clearer.
17,I don't think you have to shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.
13,"I also think that we should give visas to people green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need."
17,"People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U."
0,S.
0,of A.
9,We should make sure our legal system works.
17,"Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration."
17,There are four million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.
17,Those who've come here illegally take their place.
17,So I will not grant amnesty to those who have come here illegally.
17,What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.
17,I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.
17,"So for instance, I would not give driver's licenses to those that have come here illegally as the president would."
17,"The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident."
17,"Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration."
0,He didn't do it.
23,"He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super majority in both Houses."
17,Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?
14,What's a question I think the the president will have a chance to answer right now.
0,Yes.
14,"No, let let let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and and and let's get them correct."
9,I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.
17,"I said that the E Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation."
0,That's number one.
17,"Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked."
14,He was asked this on Univision the other day.
9,"Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?"
0,And he didn't answer.
0,He he doesn't answer that question.
14,He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.
18,"I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't."
9,Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.
14,"In his first year, I was just getting licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right."
0,I was not the standard bearer.
14,My my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.
17,"Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self deportation says let people make their own choice."
17,"What I was saying is, we're not going to round up twelve million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation."
9,Instead let people make their own choice.
2,"And if they if they find that that they can't get the benefits here that they want and they can't and they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go a place where where they have better opportunities."
9,But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and and and taking them out of this country.
17,"I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes we got to get them out of this country."
14,Let me mention something else the president said.
14,"It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth."
14,"Mister President, I'm still speaking."
14,"Mister President, let me finish."
0,I've gotta continue.
0,Just going to make a point.
9,Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.
25,"And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in in Chinese companies."
14,"Mister President, have you looked at your pension?"
34,Have you looked at your pension?
14,"Mister President, have you looked at your pension?"
27,"Well, let me give you some advice."
27,Let me give you some advice.
34,Look at your pension.
25,You also have investments in Chinese companies.
25,You also have investments outside the United States.
33,You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.
0,I'll get it done.
0,I'll get it done.
0,First year|
18,"Thank you Kerry for your question, it's an important one."
9,"And and I I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and and he takes responsibility for for that for the failure in providing those security resources, and and those terrible things may well happen from time to time."
19,I I'm I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.
5,And today there's a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.
5,We we think of their families and care for them deeply.
19,There were other issues associated with this with this tragedy.
29,"There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack."
7,And there was no demonstration involved.
29,It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.
29,"Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration."
29,How could we have not known?
29,"But I find more troubling than this, that on on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since one thousand nine hundred seventy nine, when when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event."
29,I think these these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.
27,We've read their accounts now about what happened.
29,It was very clear this was not a demonstration.
29,This was an attack by terrorists.
8,And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.
8,"Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya."
15,"Consider the distance between ourselves and and Israel, the president said that that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel."
15,We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.
8,"Syria Syria's not just a tragedy of thirty thousand civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategic strategically significant player for America."
8,"The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and and and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes."
0,"Yes, I I|"
29,I I think interesting the president just said something which which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.
29,"You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror."
29,"It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?"
29,I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president fourteen days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.
29,This the administration the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.
29,It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.
14,"And to suggest am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the your secretary|"
0,Excuse me.
14,The ambassador of the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how|
0,this was a spontaneous|
10,"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal."
18,"Boy, great question and important question, because you're absolutely right."
2,The place where we've seen manufacturing go has been China.
2,China is now the largest manufacturer in the world.
9,It used to be the United States of America.
2,A lot of good people have lost jobs.
2,A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.
9,That's total over the last four years.
2,One of the reasons for that is that people think it's more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.
25,We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.
9,What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.
2,This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.
2,"It's not by trickle down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations."
2,"Trickle down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere."
25,"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America."
9,"Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules."
15,And China hasn't.
9,One of the reasons or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.
20,"Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low."
25,And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.
0,We lose sales.
25,And manufacturers here in the U.
0,S.
25,making the same products can't compete.
15,China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.
9,"And the president has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so."
2,"On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers."
9,So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.
16,But let me let me not just stop there.
2,"Don't forget, what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish, and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they they follow the law and play by the rules, but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds."
25,"That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here."
25,Canada's tax rate on companies is now fifteen percent.
25,Ours is thirty five percent.
25,"So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?"
2,We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.
9,Regulations have quadrupled.
9,The rate of regulations quadrupled under this president.
25,I talk to small businesses across the country.
8,"They say, We feel like we're under attack from our own government."
25,"I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it."
1,And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.
2,My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.
2,"If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again."
2,The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.
9,"I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules."
0,The answer is very straightforward.
8,We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.
31,China's been cheating over the years.
20,One by holding down the value of their currency.
31,"Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology."
33,"There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods."
31,They hack into our computers.
30,"We will have to have people play on a fair basis, that's number one."
25,"Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand their business."
2,That's what brings jobs in.
14,The president's characterization of my tax plan|
0,is completely|
0,is completely|
0,is completely false.
0,Let me tell you|
2,Government does not create jobs.
2,Government does not create jobs.
0,Barry?
14,Where is Barry?
18,"Thank you, and that's an opportunity for me, and I appreciate it."
30,"In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do."
14,"In the course of that, I think the president's campaign has tried to characterize me as as someone who's very different than who I am."
30,I care about one hundred percent of the American people.
2,I want one hundred percent of the American people to have a bright and prosperous future.
13,I care about our kids.
2,I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.
25,"I spent my life in the private sector, not in government."
14,"I'm a guy who wants to help with the experience I have, the American people."
25,My my passion probably flows from the fact that I believe in God.
28,And I believe we're all children of the same God.
34,I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.
7,I I served as a missionary for my church.
7,I served as a pastor in my congregation for about ten years.
20,I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.
26,I went to the Olympics when they were in trouble to try and get them on track.
1,"And as governor of my state, I was able to get one hundred percent of my people insured, all my kids, about ninety eight percent of the adults."
13,"I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so one hundred percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future."
9,I understand that I can get this country on track again.
9,We don't have to settle for what we're going through.
12,We don't have to settle for gasoline at four bucks.
2,We don't have to settle for unemployment at a chronically high level.
2,We don't have to settle for forty seven million people on food stamps.
13,We don't have to settle for fifty percent of kids coming out of college not able to get work.
2,We don't have to settle for twenty three million people struggling to find a good job.
2,"If I become president, I'll get America working again."
4,I will get us on track to a balanced budget.
9,The president hasn't.
0,I will.
34,I'll make sure we can reform Medicare and Social Security to preserve them for coming coming generations.
9,The president said he would.
0,He didn't.
20,I'll get our incomes up.
9,"And by the way, I've done these things."
14,I served as governor and showed I could get them done.
0,"Thank you, Bob."
6,And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.
7,Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.
18,"And Mister President, it's good to be with you again."
7,"We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe funny this time, not on purpose."
0,We'll see what happens.
8,"This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a a complete change in the the structure and the the environment in the Middle East."
8,"With the Arab Spring, came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life, and in economic life in the Middle East."
15,"But instead, we've seen in nation after nation, a number of disturbing events."
8,"Of course we see in Syria, thirty thousand civilians having been killed by the military there."
29,"We see in in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think we know now, by terrorists of some kind against against our people there, four people dead."
30,Our hearts and and minds go out to them.
29,"Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by al Qaeda type individuals."
8,"We have in in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood president."
8,And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.
15,"Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon."
9,And and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.
5,I congratulate him on on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al Qaeda.
8,But we can't kill our way out of this mess.
8,"We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is it's certainly not on the run."
0,It's certainly not hiding.
15,"This is a group that is now involved in ten or twelve countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism."
8,"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to to kill them, to take them out of the picture."
25,But my strategy is broader than that.
0,"That's that's important, of course."
8,But the key that we're going to have to pursue is a is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.
8,"We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan."
9,That's not the right course for us.
8,"The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the the people who are leaders of these various anti American groups and these these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world."
9,And how do we do that?
8,"A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U."
0,N.
8,", to look at how we can help the the world reject these these terrorists."
2,"And the answer they came up with was this: One, more economic development."
15,"We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we we push back and give them more economic development."
13,"Number two, better education."
20,"Number three, gender equality."
9,"Number four, the rule of law."
8,We have to help these nations create civil societies.
8,"But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in."
15,And and they're throughout many nations in the Middle East.
29,"It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy."
15,"But next door, of course, we have Egypt."
29,"Libya's six million population; Egypt, eighty million population."
8,We want we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.
8,"With Mali now having North Mali taken over by Al Qaida; with Syria having Assad continuing to to kill, to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult."
15,"And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real."
14,"Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said."
0,They don't happen to be accurate.
8,"But but I can say this, that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing, and the rising tide of tumult and and confusion."
15,And and attacking me is not an agenda.
8,"Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and stem the tide of this violence."
14,But I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned.
15,"First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe."
0,Not|
0,Excuse me.
15,"It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face."
8,Russia does continue to battle us in the U.
0,N.
0,time and time again.
0,I have clear eyes on this.
14,"I'm not going to wear rose colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mister Putin."
14,"And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election."
30,"After the election, he'll get more backbone."
8,"Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement."
0,Oh you didn't?
0,You didn't want a status of|
8,"I'm sorry, you actually there was a there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on."
0,That was something I concurred with|
0,that your posture.
0,That was my posture as well.
8,You thought it should have been five thousand troops|
8,"I thought there should have been more troops, but you know what?"
0,The answer was we got|
8,no troops through whatsoever.
0,"No, I|"
0,I'm sorry that's a|
0,that's a I indicated|
14,I indicated that you failed to put in place a status|
8,of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that existed.
8,"Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is."
19,"First of all, thirty thousand people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster."
8,"Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now."
15,Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.
0,It's their route to the sea.
15,"It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel."
8,And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.
31,"Number two, seeing a a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us."
8,"And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there."
8,We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.
8,"And so the right course for us, is working through our partners and with our own resources, to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a in a form of if not government, a form of of of council that can take the lead in Syria."
8,And then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.
8,We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the the wrong hands.
8,Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.
15,"We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with with Israel."
15,"But the Saudi's and the Qatari, and and the Turks are all very concerned about this."
2,They're willing to work with us.
8,"We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties."
8,Recognize I believe that Assad must go.
0,I believe he will go.
8,"But I believe we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, steps that in the years to come we see Syria as a as a friend, and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East."
30,This this is a critical opportunity for America.
9,"And what I'm afraid of is we've watched over the past year or so, first the president saying, well we'll let the U."
0,N.
0,deal with it.
8,"And Assad excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we're going to try to have a ceasefire."
0,That didn't work.
9,"Then it went to the Russians and said, let's see if you can do something."
8,"We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military."
0,by the leadership role.
8,I don't want to have our military involved in Syria.
8,I don't think there is a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.
0,I don't anticipate that in the future.
8,"As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us, a responsible government, if possible."
8,"And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove to remove Assad."
8,But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our of our troops.
9,And this isn't this isn't going to be necessary.
8,"We we have, with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups."
29,"But look, this has been going on for a year."
9,This is a time this should have been a time for American leadership.
8,"We should have taken a leading role, not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally to bring together the parties; to find responsible parties."
8,"As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the the insurgents are highly disparate."
0,They haven't come together.
7,"They haven't formed a unity group, a council of some kind."
0,That needs to happen.
9,America can help that happen.
8,And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role which is getting rid of Assad.
0,No.
14,"I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his his action there."
7,I felt that I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.
15,"I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the president's term and even further back than that, that we'd have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didn't explode in the way that it did."
29,"But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our principles and the President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support."
8,"Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more is peaceful."
15,We want a peaceful planet.
8,"We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war."
0,That's our purpose.
5,And the mantle of leadership for the promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.
0,We didn't ask for it.
5,But it's an honor that we have it.
8,But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong.
2,And that begins with a strong economy here at home.
2,"Unfortunately, the economy is not stronger."
15,"When the when the president of Iraq excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, that's a frightening thing."
4,Former chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that Admiral Mullen said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.
2,This we have weakened our economy.
2,We need a strong economy.
8,We need to have as well a strong military.
8,Our military is second to none in the world.
5,"We're blessed with terrific soldiers, and extraordinary technology and intelligence."
4,But the idea of a trillion dollar in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.
8,We need to have strong allies.
15,Our association and connection with our allies is essential to America's strength.
15,"We're the great nation that has allies, forty two allies and friends around the world."
30,"And, finally, we have to stand by our principles."
30,"And if we're strong in each of those things, American influence will grow."
30,"But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence will grow."
9,"But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago."
30,And that's because we've become weaker in each of those four|
8,"Well I I absolutely believe that America has a a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that that make the world more peaceful."
30,"And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections."
30,"Because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace."
30,They don't vote for war.
15,So we want to promote those principles around the world.
8,We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.
8,We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.
8,"But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong."
30,America must lead.
2,"And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home."
2,You can't have twenty three million people struggling to get a job.
2,You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.
13,"You can't have kids coming out of college, half of them can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree."
2,We have to get our economy going.
5,"And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long term."
8,We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.
8,We we make decisions today in the military that that will confront challenges we can't imagine.
29,"In the two thousand debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance."
5,"And a year later, nine/eleven happened."
8,"So, we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military."
4,I will not cut our military budget.
15,We have to also stand by our allies.
15,I I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.
15,"I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us."
15,"And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake."
5,"We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy."
6,I've got a policy for the future and agenda for the future.
2,"And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create twelve million new jobs and rising take home pay."
14,And what we've seen over the last four years is something I don't want to see over the next four years.
14,The president said by now we'd be a five.
2,four percent unemployment.
2,We're nine million jobs short of that.
2,"I will get America working again and see rising take home pay again, and I'll do it with five simple steps."
12,"Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence."
12,"We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables."
2,"Number two, we're going to increase our trade."
25,Trade grows about twelve percent year.
34,It doubles about every every five or so years.
9,"We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America."
17,The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.
2,"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China."
15,We're all focused on China.
17,"Latin America is a huge opportunity for us time zone, language opportunities."
13,"Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers' unions going to have to go behind."
4,And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.
25,We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.
4,And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.
4,And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.
25,"And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business."
25,Small business is where jobs come from.
25,Two thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.
25,New business formation is down to the lowest level in thirty years under this administration.
2,I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take home pay.
6,"Well well, I need to speak a moment|"
13,"if you'll let me, Bob, just about education|"
14,because I'm I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.
13,We have every two years tests that look at how well our kids are doing.
13,Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.
13,"While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all fifty states in English, and then also in math."
13,And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.
9,First time one state had been number one in all four measures.
0,How did we do that?
13,"Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom."
9,And that was that was that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.
4,And then you cut education spending when you came into office.
13,The first the first the first and we kept our schools number one in the nation.
30,They're still number one today.
13,"And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four year tuition free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning."
14,"That was actually mine, actually, Mister President."
0,You got that fact wrong.
24,"Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way all the way through."
4,"First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning we're going to cut about five percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military."
0,That's number one.
0,The good news is.
18,I'd be happy to have you take a look.
27,Come on our website.
4,You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to ten years.
4,"We do it by getting by reducing spending in a whole series of progra Miss By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare."
4,"There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them."
20,And that one doesn't sound good and it's not affordable.
27,So I'd get rid of that one from day one.
8,"To the extent humanly possible, we get that out."
4,"We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have, and we get rid of them."
34,"Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently."
14,"As a governor, I thought please, give me this program."
9,"I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it."
34,"States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost effectively."
4,I want to do those two things and get this get this to a balanced budget with eight eight to ten years.
24,"But the military let's get back to the military, though."
4,I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.
25,I was on the world of business for twenty five years.
4,"If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business."
26,"I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance, and made a success there."
14,I had the chance to be governor of a state.
4,"Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget."
4,We cut taxes nineteen times and balanced our budget.
4,The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.
18,I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.
4,I'm going to be able to balance the budget.
4,"Let's talk about military spending, and that's this."
5,"Our Navy is old excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than at any time since one thousand nine hundred seventeen."
5,The Navy said they needed three hundred thirteen ships to carry out their mission.
6,We're now at under two hundred eighty five.
4,We're headed down to the low two hundreds if we go through a sequestration.
0,That's unacceptable to me.
8,I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.
5,Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time since it was founded in one thousand nine hundred forty seven.
8,We've changed for the first time since FDR since FDR we had the we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.
8,Now we're changing to one conflict.
9,"Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people."
4,"And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts."
31,"That, in my view, is making is making our future less certain and less secure."
15,"Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president made which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel."
15,"And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily."
0,That's number one.
15,"Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear capable Iran is unacceptable to America."
15,"It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us."
15,"It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means."
15,"And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference."
15,"I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one."
0,And they do work.
2,You're seeing it right now in the economy.
15,"It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions."
9,I would have put them in place earlier.
26,But it's good that we have them.
15,"Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions."
15,"I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports."
0,I imagine the E.
0,U.
18,would agree with us as well.
12,"Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't."
15,I would tighten those sanctions further.
15,"Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts."
15,I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.
14,His words amount to genocide incitation.
9,I would indict him for it.
15,I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.
15,The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.
15,"We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a a a solution to this, which says which stops this this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America."
8,"And of course, a military action is the last resort."
9,It is something one would only only consider if all of the other avenues had been had been tried to their full extent.
15,"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be."
8,I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.
14,"And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran."
22,"And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States."
29,"And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America."
8,I think they looked at that and saw weakness.
15,"Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent."
0,I think they noticed that as well.
15,"And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well."
15,"All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges."
15,"Now there are some ten thousand centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world."
9,"That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable."
15,And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.
15,They must not develop nuclear capability.
15,"And the way to make sure they understand that is by having, from the very beginning, the tightest sanctions possible."
0,They need to be tightened.
15,Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.
15,We need to indict Ahmadinejad.
8,"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action."
15,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.
15,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.
15,And and we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.
0,That's number one.
29,"Number two, Mister President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq."
15,"And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations."
15,"And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel."
15,"And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive."
9,You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.
9,"Mister President, America has not dictated to other nations."
8,We have freed other nations from dictators.
9,"Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature."
15,"Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way."
9,This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of |
18,But let me let me come back we can come back.
14,"Let's come back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and the president's statement that things are going so well."
15,"Look, I look at what's happening around the world, and i see Iran four years closer to a bomb."
15,"I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult."
8,"I see jihadists continuing to spread, whether they're rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there."
0,They're very strong.
8,"I see Syria with thirty thousand civilians dead, Assad still in power."
4,"I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's growing larger every year, as a matter of fact."
15,"I look around the world and I don't feel that you see North Korea, continuing to export their nuclear technology, Russia said they're not going to follow Nunn Lugar any more."
15,They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.
27,"I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world."
15,"I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the the the turmoil with Israel."
15,"I mean, the president received a letter from thirty eight Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem."
16,"They asked him, please repair the tension Democrat senators please repair the tension|"
23,the damage in his in his own party.
0,Bob|
9,You can't but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.
0,"Well, that's probably true."
8,"Well, we're going to be finished by two thousand fourteen, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of two thousand fourteen."
24,The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.
7,We've seen progress over the past several years.
13,The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.
8,"There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, three hundred fifty thousand that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of two thousand fourteen."
8,So our troops will come home at that point.
8,"I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan."
8,And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.
15,"And I don't mean you, Mister President, but some people in the in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem."
15,"But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has one hundred nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more."
15,They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the in the relatively near future.
15,They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.
15,"And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us."
15,And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.
15,And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.
8,"So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of two thousand fourteen."
15,"No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has one hundred nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network."
8,It's a nation that's not like like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.
15,"You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the of three branches there."
9,Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.
15,"This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got you've got terrorists there who could grab their their hands onto those nuclear weapons."
30,This is this is an important part of the world for us.
15,"Pakistan is is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now."
2,But we have some work to do.
29,And I I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.
15,We we had to go into Pakistan.
29,We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.
0,That was the right thing to do.
29,"And and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that."
8,But we're going to have to work with the with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.
28,And it's important for them.
15,It's important for the nuclear weapons.
8,It's important for the success of Afghanistan.
15,"Because inside Pakistan, you have a a large group of Pashtun that are that are Taliban."
8,They're going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go.
8,And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.
15,But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.
10,"But we do need to make sure that as we as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society."
8,Well I believe we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.
31,"And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends."
8,"But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and and killing bad guys, important as that is."
8,We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.
9,We haven't done that yet.
6,"We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the the record, you look at the record."
15,You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?
0,Yes.
15,Is the Middle East in tumult?
0,Yes.
8,"Is is al Qaida on he run, on its heels?"
0,No.
15,Is are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?
14,"No, they haven't had talks in two years."
8,"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands."
25,"Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful."
25,It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.
15,"Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran."
15,Let's talk about China.
15,"China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world."
8,They don't want war.
2,They don't want to see protectionism.
2,"They don't want to see the world break out into into various forms of chaos, because they have to they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about twenty thousand twenty million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs."
2,So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.
15,And so we can be a partner with China.
8,"We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form."
8,"We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible."
15,"Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?"
8,How strong are we going to be?
2,How strong is our economy?
4,"They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people dollar sixteen trillion in total, including that."
8,They look at our our decision to to cut back on our military capabilities.
0,A trillion dollars.
4,The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.
4,"It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating."
14,"It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating."
15,"They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK."
30,Is America going to be strong?
9,"And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong."
15,We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.
2,"I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency."
20,It holds down the prices of their goods.
2,It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.
0,That's got to end.
2,They're making some progress; they need to make more.
2,"That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs."
31,"They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods."
8,They have to understand we want to trade with them.
8,We want a world that's stable.
25,"We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."
27,"Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year."
8,So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.
27,"And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it."
0,It's a silent one.
26,And they're winning.
2,"We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before."
2,And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.
26,"We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively."
0,We understand it.
0,But this can't keep on going.
31,"You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States."
11,"I was with one company that makes valves and and process industries and they said, look, we were we were having some valves coming in that that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and and they had our serial number on them."
29,And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.
17,They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.
0,S.
25,"company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U."
0,S.
0,competitor.
0,This can't go on.
15,I want a great relationship with China.
15,"China can be our partner, but but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis."
2,"I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country."
2,But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.
29,Nothing could be further from the truth.
0,I'm a son of Detroit.
0,I was born in Detroit.
25,My dad was head of a car company.
0,I like American cars.
9,And I would do nothing to hurt the U.
0,S.
0,auto industry.
25,My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.
9,It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.
0,I disagree with that.
25,I said they need these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.
4,"And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd they'd built up."
0,And fortunately|
27,You can take a look at the op ed|
25,"I said that we would provide guarantees, and and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy."
2,Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.
25,"And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not."
0,Of course not.
0,That's the height of silliness|
4,I have never said I would liquidate|
25,I would liquidate the industry.
2,and and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.
15,"We in this country can can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to."
12,"We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in in car companies like Tesla and and Fisker, making electric battery cars."
9,"This is not research, Mr President, these are the government investing in companies."
12,Investing in Solyndra.
25,"This is a company, this isn't basic research."
25,I I want to invest in research.
0,Research is great.
13,Providing funding to universities and think tanks is great.
25,But investing in companies?
0,Absolutely not.
0,That's the wrong way to go.
0,I'm still speaking.
2,So I want to make sure that we make we make America more competitive.
25,"And that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow."
25,But you're investing in companies doesn't do that.
17,In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here|
2,because the private sector's not going to invest in a|
0,company|
0,if if you're|
0,get someone else's.
0,You're wrong|
0,you're wrong.
0,"People can look it up, you're right."
0,Good.
9,"I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years."
20,"The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle income families, now down dollar four thousand three hundred during your term."
2,Twenty three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.
2,When you came to office thirty two million people on food stamps.
2,"Today, forty seven million people on food stamps."
4,"When you came to office, just over dollar ten trillion in debt, now dollar sixteen trillion in debt."
0,It hasn't worked.
6,You said by now we'd be at five.
2,four percent unemployment.
2,We're nine million jobs short of that.
0,I've met some of those people.
7,"I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin."
7,"I met a young woman in in Philadelphia who's coming out of out of college, can't find work."
20,I've been Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.
2,"It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours, that the last four years have been so hard."
2,"And that's why it's so critical, that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy."
13,And that's not going to happen by just hiring teachers.
13,"Look, I love to I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers do that."
13,"By the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its weight deeper and deeper into our schools."
9,Let the states and localities do that.
0,I was a governor.
13,The federal government didn't hire our teachers.
13,But I love teachers.
25,But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.
0,Thank you.
7,"Bob, Mister President, folks at Lynn University, good to be with you."
0,I'm optimistic about the future.
26,I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.
28,I want to see peace.
15,I want to see growing peace in this country.
0,It's our objective.
8,We have an opportunity to have real leadership.
15,America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.
2,I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.
9,And there are two very different paths the country can take.
4,"One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have dollar twenty trillion in debt heading towards Greece."
4,I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.
9,The president's path will mean continuing declining in take home pay.
20,I want to make sure our take home pay turns around and starts to grow.
9,The president's path will mean continuing declining in take home pay.
20,I want to make sure take home pay turns around and starts to grow.
2,The president's path means twenty million people out of work struggling for a good job.
2,I'll get people back to work with twelve million new jobs.
2,"I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs."
2,"America's going to come back, and for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle."
23,I was in a state where my legislature was eighty seven percent Democrat.
7,I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.
9,We've got to do that in Washington.
1,Washington is broken.
2,"I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that."
30,This nation is the hope of the earth.
5,We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the greatest generation.
5,They've held a torch for the world to see the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.
12,"Now, it's our turn to take that torch."
0,I'm convinced we'll do it.
8,We need strong leadership.
18,I'd like to be that leader with your support.
0,I'll work with you.
30,"I'll lead you in an open and honest way, and I ask for your vote."
14,I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation and to make sure that we all together remain America as the hope of the earth.
18,Thank you so much.
