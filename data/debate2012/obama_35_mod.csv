obama president congressman,"No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.",2,0,53,obama president congressman,0

obamacare healthcare insurance,Because there there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.,2,0,62,obamacare healthcare insurance,1
obamacare healthcare insurance,"One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.",2,0,63,obamacare healthcare insurance,1

obamacare healthcare insurance,"So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.",2,0,66,obamacare healthcare insurance,1
